<h1>Thanks so much for sending an email to your lawmakers.</h1>

<p>Our work today will help propel forward critical reforms to curtail the NSA's
mass spying programs and protect our rights and democracy.  Sending an email is
a great start, but we need you to do two more things:</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people are calling Congress today. Will you join them?
It's 10 times as impactful as sending an email, it'll only take 2 minutes, and
we'll make it easy for you by giving you a call script and connecting you to
the right office.</p>

<p>Then, or if you can't call, please share info about The Day We Fight Back, to
make sure as many people as possible are taking part.</p>

<p>If we persist, we will win this fight.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks so much.</strong></p>

<p>- The Day We Fight Back team</p>
